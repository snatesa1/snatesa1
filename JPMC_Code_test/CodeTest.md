Please make any assumptions you want and state them clearly. Ensure that you have handled any edge case scenarios carefully. Emphasize will be given to accuracy, 
performance and readability aspects as well.

Problem 1:

Given a long statement and a input letter, find the word which contains the most number of the given character. If more than one word has the exact same number of the given letter,
it should return the word with the most number of total letters, if more than one words have equal number of given character and total number of characters return the word that appeared first
in the given statement.

Assumptions:
	1. The key assumptions for this problem is the two input variables long statement and a input letter.
  2. Long statement can be any paragraph length but there shouldn't be any new line character and it should be separated with spaces.(not with any other delimiter)
  3. The paragraph can have any special characters and number's .
  4. Input letter is case sensitive 
 Above are the key assumptions for this problems

Edge Case Scenarios:
  1. Removing the special characters and numerals while processing.
  2. Ensuring the search character is a alpbhabet before processing the logic.
  3. Handling No proper input character by checking size of the max_count and words_with_max_count array.
  4. Handling No match case by checking the search character validity and its presence in the sentence


Problem 2:

Write a function that accept a number and returns the starting position of the longest continuous sequence of 1s in its binary format.

Assumptions:
  1. The input must be an integer; no other data types are accepted.
  2. The numpy library is used to convert the integer to binary values to maintain consistency in the binary output( in terms of string length)
These are the key assumptions for this problem.

Edge Case Scenarios:
  1. Handling for Sequence occurance in the middle/end/start.
  3. Handling for no sequence occurance and all one's in the binary string.
  4. Handling for multiple sequence of same length to return only the first sequence.
